Library Method Conventions
==========================
NOTE:
All methods are Asynchronous, and will return a standard `(err, res, body)` params to your callback. 
Body will already be json parsed into a json object for easy handling.


Methods
=======

---
`.login(username, password, callback)`

Call this first to authenticate before calling other methods.

Takes a username and password, the same ones you use to login on the okc website.

Upon success, response will automatically store a cookie for subsequent requests.

---
`.getQuickmatch(callback)`

This is the method you want to call first. 
It gets you a new user in the area. Json body will contain target_userid and username for yoou to call `.rate`, `.visitUser`, `.getUserProfile`.

*Username is obtained via `body.sn`*

*Target_userid is obtained via `body.tuid`*

---
`.visitUser(username, callback)`

Takes a username. This visit method will emulate you actually visiting the user via browser. 

*Will register on the user's visitors list,* so they will know you visited them.


`.rate(target_userid, score, callback)`

Takes a user_id and a score rating integer (1-5). This is equivalent to the 1-5 star rating.

---
`.getUserProfile(username, callback)`
